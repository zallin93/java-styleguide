# Java Style Guide

## Nobody Team Endorsed
So far, nobody has reviewed or contributed feeback, thus this style guide is my own. 

## Purpose
*Opinionated Java style guide for all users.*

This is the place where I tell you how to style your code, and you do it.  If you don't like it, then at least consider the points I suggest.  Too often do I see poor standards in enterprise-level Java code. 

The purpose of this guide is to show how I build my Java applications, and write my code so that it is easily read, understood, and then used by other programmers.  

If you like this guide, sweet.  If you don't, I'm still glad you read it. 

## Credit
I believe that credit should be given where credit is due.  If you provide me with input, I will do my best to credit you where appropriate. 

If you happen to use my guide, please feel free to let me know.  The more it is used, the more I will add and keep up with the latest "best practices."

## Sample Application
At some point in the future, I may add a sample application to this repository that shows a complete project with my styles implemented.  For now, this is what you get.

## Comments
Comments are the most useful text in any applications.  Without them, no one would understand your spaghetti code you wrote when you were drinking last night.  
Even when I find myself 4 PBR's deep, if I have comments in my code, I am able to figure out what my code is doing relatively-easily.
