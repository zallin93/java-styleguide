# Zach Allin's Johnny Papa Java Style Guide

## Versions
There are multiple versions of Java, but there is only one version of this style-guide.  This is the only one you get. 

## Credit
Inspiration for this style-guide goes to John Papa, author of the original "Angular Style Guide", as well as Chris Hope for suggesting that a Johnny-Papa guide is not the guide we need, but the guide we deserve. 

Navigate to the Java folder for the actual style-guide, rather than this silly informational file.
