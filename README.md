# Zach Allin's Johnny Papa Style Guides

## Versions
There are multiple versions of programming languages, but there is only one version of this style-guide.  This is the only one you get. 

## Credit
Inspiration for this style-guide goes to John Papa, author of the original [Angular Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide), as well as [Chris Hope](https://github.com/cjhope) for suggesting that a Johnny-Papa guide is not the guide we need, but the guide we deserve. 

Navigate to the corresponding folders for the actual style-guides, rather than this silly informational file. 

If you happen to be interested in ReactJS, I highly suggest you review [Chris Hope's Johnny Papa React Style Guide](https://github.com/cjhope/react-style-guide).
